# Vehicle_Detector
This is a github project done during the Fall of Semester
- Its about detecting Vehicles using Open_CV.
- Vehicle detection and statistics in highway monitoring video scenes are of considerable significance to intelligent traffic management and control of the highway .
- The traditional machine vision method has a faster speed when detecting the vehicle but does not produce a good result when the image changes in brightness, there is periodic motion in the background, and where there are slow moving vehicles or complex scenes.
